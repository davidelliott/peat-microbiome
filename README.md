#### Bacterial and fungal communities in degraded bare peat show rapid and concerted responses to restoration-linked re-vegetation but remain distinct from long-term vegetated and naturally re-vegetated zones in an ombrotrophic peatland 

The UK hosts 15-19% of global upland ombotrophic (rain fed) peatlands that are estimated to store 3.2 billion tonnes of carbon, sequestered through the imbalance of growth and decay.  Growth is driven by photosynthetic organisms including Sphagnum mosses, whereas decay is reliant on the actions of microorganisms that are limited by cold, acidic, and anaerobic conditions. Healthy peatlands capture carbon, provide unique habitat, and aid water management among many other benefits. Ecosystem degradation caused by various factors is visibly manifested as a loss of vegetation leading to erosion and deep gullying. Degraded peatlands do not always naturally recover, therefore active restoration programmes are sometimes undertaken to regain peat stability and functionality. It is clear that microorganisms drive or influence many peatland processes not limited to decay, but little is known about the microorganisms in peatlands, or their roles in ecosystem change.

Our aim was to characterise bacterial and fungal communities in degraded bare peat, long-term stable vegetated peat, and natural and managed restorations at various stages. We show that these zones support distinct microbial communities that can be linked to natural processes and human intervention in the management of peatlands. Microbial community evidence suggests that bare peat is functionally impaired, and that re-vegetation restores functional potential in the peat microbiome. Bare peat had distinct microbial community structure, with lower diversity and lower cultivable bacteria and fungi compared to all the other zones. We detected rapid and concerted bacterial and fungal community responses to early re-vegetation of bare peat with nurse grasses and heather seedling establishment. Restored bare peat did not approach a similar microbial community structure to non-eroded areas even after 25 years, and this may be related to the stabilisation of historic deposited heavy metals pollution in long-term stable areas.
